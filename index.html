            SAM is a social chat bot that learns about the user through conversation, and introduces them to friends that they are highly compatible with.
            Most educated people will move to a new city at least once in their lives, usually for school or work. Making friends in a new area can be painful, as the most common way for adults to meet new friends or partners is through by mutual friends. When you're in a new city, you often times don't have any mutual friends.
            Recent studies show that 60% of college students, and 40% of adults in the United States regularly experience feelings of loneliness. This is a problem, because having close relationships is one of the best predictors of life satisfaction and happiness.
            SAM will target people that have recently relocated, beginning with a beachhead market of college freshman that have just begun school. Using machine learning and natural language processing, SAM will act as a mutual friend that helps connect compatible people together.
